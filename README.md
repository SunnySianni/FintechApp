# Project Summary: FinTech Application
The FinTech Application is a web-based project designed to manage user accounts and their financial transactions. It leverages modern technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL to deliver a robust and scalable backend. The application provides features like user creation, transaction management, and database interaction using RESTful APIs, and serves a simple HTML frontend.

# Features

User Account Management:
Users can create accounts with validation for secure and accurate data entry.

Transaction Management:
Record and retrieve financial transactions with detailed attributes like amount, type, description, and user association.

Database Interaction:
Relational database setup with models for users and transactions.
Sequelize ORM for managing database operations and relationships.

API:
Routes to handle user and transaction data operations efficiently.

Environment Configuration:
Use .env files for secure storage of database credentials and server configurations.

Development Tools:
Nodemon for live server reloading during development.
Organized project structure for modular and maintainable code.

Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
Express.js: Framework for building web applications and APIs.
MySQL: Relational database for structured data storage.
Sequelize: ORM for simplified database interactions.
dotenv: Secure environment variable management.
Nodemon: Automatic server restarts during development.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or later).
MySQL (v5.7 or later).
A package manager like npm.
Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fintech-app.git
cd fintech-app

Install Dependencies:
npm install

Set Up the Database:
Create a database named finTech using MySQL Workbench or CLI.

Add database credentials to a .env file in the root directory:
env

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=finTech
PORT=3000

Run the Application:
npm start
This command will start the server with Nodemon, which watches for file changes and restarts automatically.

API Endpoints
POST /users: Create a new user.
POST /transactions: Record a new transaction for a user.
GET /transactions: Retrieve all transactions for a specific user.
GET /status: Check if the server is running.

How It Works
Database Integration:

Establishes a connection to the MySQL database using Sequelize.
Defines models for User and Transaction with relationships (e.g., a User has many Transactions).

API Logic:
routes/index.js contains endpoints to handle CRUD operations for users and transactions.
Uses Express.js middleware for request parsing and response handling.

Dynamic Environment Configuration:
Reads sensitive database credentials from .env for secure and flexible configuration.

Modular Design:
Organized structure separates concerns for database, models, routes, and the server.
